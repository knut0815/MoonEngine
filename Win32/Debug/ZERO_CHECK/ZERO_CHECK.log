  CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:30 (add_subdirectory):
    Policy CMP0013 is not set: Duplicate binary directories are not allowed.
    Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0013" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
    command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
  
    The binary directory
  
      C:/Users/Derek Nola/Documents/GitHub/MoonEngine/_build/deps/assimp
  
    is already used to build a source directory.  This command uses it to build
    source directory
  
      C:/Users/Derek Nola/Documents/GitHub/MoonEngine/deps/assimp
  
    which can generate conflicting build files.  CMake does not support this
    use case but it used to work accidentally and is being allowed for
    compatibility.
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
